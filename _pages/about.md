Hi, I'm **Yikang Pan**, a **senior undergraduate student majoring in computer science** at **Zhejiang University**. I am passionate about languages and their applications in the real world. I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. Jie Yang as a research intern at ZJU on cross-lingual language model pre-training. I have been investigating the field of Open-Domain Question-Answering with unreliable sources supervised by Prof. Min-yen Kan and Dr. Liangming Pan; looking forward to my journey at NUS:)

Currently I am going through the emotional roller-coaster part of applying to graduate schools. In my spare time, I enjoy tennis, comedy series and indie rock songs.
